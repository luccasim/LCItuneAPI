But his current quest could interfere with a CIA sting, and that puts a target on Dexter's back. He is both hunter and hunted. Sam Elliott stars as Dexter in this suspense thriller based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth (The Day of the Jackal) and executive-produced by Wolfgang Petersen (Troy, Poseidon). Timothy Hutton portrays the CIA handler ordered to make Dexter disappear.

It has been filmed many times by many directors, but few productions are remembered as fondly as this one. The potent combination of director Chang Cheh and international idol Alexander Fu Sheng caught lightning in a lens. Even so, many were concerned, since this was one of the director’s first Kung fu films without the collaboration of his long-time martial arts choreographer Liu Chia-liang. But with new action instructors Hsieh Hsing (future fighting star of \"Master of the Flying Guillotine\") and Chen Hsin-yi (who also choreographed Jackie Chan in \"To Kill with Intrigue\"), not to mention his talented co-director Wu Ma (future director of the groundbreaking \"The Dead and the Deadly\"), Chang continued his string of hits with this action-packed adventure."}]
